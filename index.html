        <h2>Sophmore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophmore at Bob Jones University studying Theatre. I act in plays produced by the Theatre department and am currently in Twelfth Night.</p>
         <p>
            I am a geek who is afraid of bees. Please send help if you see them trying to land on me. It is my worst nightmare, I would rather perish.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy listening to music and watching movies. I also enjoy spending my time singing, frolicking in vast fields, and scaring young children.
